## Using a useful trick `count()` 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
install.packages("rjson") 
```

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

```

```{r}
install.packages('spotifyr')
```

Now that we have imported the libraries we can import the data
```{r}
myDataJson<-fromJSON("./MyData/YourLibrary.json")
```


using the count trick I learned from David Robinson we can see which artist is likey my favorite by the amount of saved tracks i have from them 
```{r}
myDataJson$tracks %>% 
  count(artist, sort = T)
```


```{r}
myDataJson$tracks %>% 
  filter(artist == "Bring Me The Horizon")
```
I've been a huge BMTH fan since early 2015 I listed all the tracks I have saved by them incase anyone was curious
